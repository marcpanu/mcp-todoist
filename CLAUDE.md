## Architecture

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates Claude with the Todoist API. The codebase has been modularized into a well-structured architecture.

### Key Components

- **MCP Server**: Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for MCP protocol implementation
- **Todoist Integration**: Uses `@doist/todoist-api-typescript` client library
- **Transport**: Runs on stdio transport for communication with MCP clients

### Modular Architecture

The codebase follows a clean, domain-driven architecture with focused modules for improved maintainability:

#### Core Infrastructure

### Tool Architecture

The server exposes 28 tools organized by entity type with standardized naming convention using underscores (MCP-compliant):

**Task Management:**
- `todoist_task_create` - Creates new tasks with full attribute support
- `todoist_task_get` - Retrieves and filters tasks (with caching)
- `todoist_task_update` - Updates existing tasks found by name search
- `todoist_task_delete` - Deletes tasks found by name search
- `todoist_task_complete` - Marks tasks as complete found by name search

**Subtask Management:**
- `todoist_subtask_create` - Creates subtasks under parent tasks with full attribute support
- `todoist_subtasks_bulk_create` - Creates multiple subtasks under a parent task efficiently
- `todoist_task_convert_to_subtask` - Converts existing tasks to subtasks of another task
- `todoist_subtask_promote` - Promotes subtasks to main tasks (removes parent relationship)
- `todoist_task_hierarchy_get` - Retrieves task hierarchies with completion percentage tracking

**Bulk Task Operations:**
- `todoist_tasks_bulk_create` - Creates multiple tasks at once for improved efficiency
- `todoist_tasks_bulk_update` - Updates multiple tasks based on search criteria
- `todoist_tasks_bulk_delete` - Deletes multiple tasks based on search criteria
- `todoist_tasks_bulk_complete` - Completes multiple tasks based on search criteria

**Comment Management:**
- `todoist_comment_create` - Adds comments to tasks with optional file attachments
- `todoist_comment_get` - Retrieves comments for tasks or projects

**Label Management:**
- `todoist_label_get` - Lists all labels with IDs, names, and colors
- `todoist_label_create` - Creates new labels with optional color, order, and favorite status
- `todoist_label_update` - Updates existing labels by ID or name (supports all attributes)
- `todoist_label_delete` - Deletes labels by ID or name
- `todoist_label_stats` - Provides detailed usage statistics and analytics

**Project Management:**
- `todoist_project_create` - Creates new projects with optional color and favorite status
- `todoist_project_get` - Lists all projects with their IDs and names

**Section Management:**
- `todoist_section_create` - Creates sections within projects
- `todoist_section_get` - Lists sections within projects

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- `todoist_test_connection` - Quick API token validation and connection test
- `todoist_test_all_features` - Dual-mode testing: basic (read-only) and enhanced (full CRUD with cleanup)
- `todoist_test_performance` - Performance benchmarking with configurable iterations

### Error Handling Strategy

Structured error handling with custom error types:
- `ValidationError` - Input validation failures
- `TaskNotFoundError` - Task search failures
- `LabelNotFoundError` - Label search failures
- `SubtaskError` - Subtask operation failures
- `TodoistAPIError` - Todoist API failures
- `AuthenticationError` - Token validation failures

### Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: 30-second TTL cache for GET operations to reduce API calls
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic cache clearing on mutations (create/update/delete)
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time and runtime type checking

### Search Strategy

For update, delete, and complete operations, the server uses partial string matching against task content (case-insensitive) to find tasks, enabling natural language task identification.

### Bulk Operations Strategy

Bulk operations provide significant efficiency improvements by allowing multiple tasks to be processed in a single API call:

- **Bulk Create**: Accepts an array of task objects and creates them sequentially, providing detailed feedback on successes and failures
- **Bulk Update/Delete/Complete**: Uses flexible search criteria to identify target tasks:
  - `project_id`: Filter by specific project
  - `priority`: Filter by priority level (1 highest, 4 lowest)
  - `due_before`/`due_after`: Filter by due date ranges (YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - `content_contains`: Filter by text within task content
- **Error Handling**: Each bulk operation reports individual successes and failures for better debugging
- **Cache Management**: Bulk operations automatically clear relevant caches to ensure consistency

### Subtask Architecture

Hierarchical task management with parent-child relationships:

- **Creation Strategy**: Subtasks are created using the `parent_id` field in the Todoist API
- **API Compatibility**: Uses delete & recreate pattern for converting tasks to subtasks due to API limitations
- **Hierarchy Building**: Recursive algorithm builds task trees with completion percentage calculation
- **Task Conversion**:
  - `Convert to Subtask`: Deletes original task and recreates with `parent_id`
  - `Promote Subtask`: Deletes subtask and recreates as main task without `parent_id`
- **Completion Tracking**: Calculates completion percentages for parent tasks based on subtask status
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient creation of multiple subtasks under a single parent
- **Tree Visualization**: `formatTaskHierarchy()` provides hierarchical display with completion indicators
- **Cache Integration**: Subtask operations integrated with 30-second TTL caching system
- **Search Strategy**: Supports both task ID and name-based parent/child identification

### Dry-Run Mode Architecture

Complete simulation framework for safe testing and validation:

- **DryRunWrapper Class**: Located in `src/utils/dry-run-wrapper.ts`, wraps TodoistApi to intercept mutations
- **Environment Activation**: Enabled when `process.env.DRYRUN=true`
- **Real Data Validation**: Uses actual API calls to validate projects, tasks, sections, and labels exist
- **Simulated Mutations**: Create, update, delete, and complete operations are simulated (not executed)
- **Read Operations**: Pass through to real API unchanged for authentic data queries
- **Mock Response Generation**: Returns realistic mock data with generated IDs for mutation operations
- **Detailed Logging**: Clear `[DRY-RUN]` prefixes show exactly what operations would perform
- **Factory Pattern**: `createTodoistClient()` function automatically wraps client based on environment
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 28 MCP tools support dry-run mode with full validation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions for all dry-run operations

### Data Flow Pattern

1. **Request Validation**: Type guards validate incoming parameters
2. **Input Sanitization**: Validation functions check business rules
3. **Cache Check**: GET operations check cache first
4. **API Call**: Execute Todoist API operation (or simulate in dry-run mode)
5. **Cache Management**: Update/invalidate cache as needed
6. **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with error codes

### Environment Requirements

- `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` environment variable is required and validated at startup
- Server exits with error code 1 if token is missing
- `DRYRUN=true` optional environment variable enables dry-run mode for safe testing

### Testing Infrastructure

The codebase includes comprehensive testing capabilities:

**Unit Tests:**
- Jest configured for ESM modules with ts-jest
- Type guard unit tests in `src/__tests__/type-guards.test.ts`
- Test imports use TypeScript extensions (not .js)

**Integration Tests:**
- `src/__tests__/integration.test.ts` - Full API integration testing
- Requires `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` environment variable for execution
- Tests skip gracefully when token is not available
- Comprehensive testing of all MCP tools and API operations

**Dry-Run Tests:**
- `src/__tests__/dry-run-wrapper.test.ts` - Comprehensive dry-run mode validation
- Tests all mutation operations (create, update, delete, complete) in simulation mode
- Validates real data queries pass through unchanged
- Tests error handling and validation in dry-run mode

**Built-in Testing Tools:**
- `todoist_test_connection` - Validates API token and connection
- `todoist_test_all_features` - Dual-mode testing:
  - Basic mode: Read-only tests for tasks, projects, labels, sections, comments (default)
  - Enhanced mode: Full CRUD testing with automatic cleanup including subtasks
- `todoist_test_performance` - Benchmarks API response times with configurable iterations

**Enhanced Testing Infrastructure:**
- **Comprehensive CRUD Testing**: 18 tests across 4 suites (Task, Subtask, Label, Bulk Operations)
- **Automatic Test Data Management**: Generates unique test data with timestamps
- **Complete Cleanup**: Removes all test data after testing to prevent workspace pollution
- **Detailed Reporting**: Response times, success/failure metrics, and error details
- **Suite Organization**: Grouped tests by functionality for better debugging

**Running Tests:**
- `npm test` - Runs all tests (unit tests always, integration tests if token available)
- `TODOIST_API_TOKEN=your-token npm test` - Runs with integration tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Runs tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Runs tests with coverage report

### Code Quality

- ESLint with TypeScript rules and Prettier integration
- Strict TypeScript configuration with explicit return types
- No `any` types - proper TypeScript interfaces throughout

### Distribution

- Built as ES modules targeting ES2020
- Executable binary at `dist/index.js` with shebang
- Published as `@greirson/mcp-todoist`

### CI/CD and Quality Assurance

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline with multi-Node.js version testing (18.x, 20.x, 22.x)
- **Dependabot Integration**: Automated dependency updates with CI validation
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Linting and type checking enforced before commits
- **Release Automation**: Automated NPM publishing on version tags

### API Compatibility Handling

Due to evolving Todoist API types, the codebase uses defensive programming patterns:
- **Response Format Handling**: Uses `extractArrayFromResponse()` helper to handle multiple API response formats (direct arrays, `result.results`, `result.data`)
- **Type Assertions**: Strategic type assertions for API compatibility while maintaining type safety
- **Error Recovery**: Try-catch patterns for API signature changes
- **Flexible Response Parsing**: Handles both array and object responses gracefully
- **Testing Integration**: Built-in test tools validate API compatibility across different response formats

### Important Notes

- **Tool Names**: All MCP tool names use underscores (e.g., `todoist_task_create`) to comply with MCP naming requirements `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`
- **Cache Strategy**: GET operations are cached for 30 seconds; mutation operations (create/update/delete) clear the cache
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Enable with `DRYRUN=true` environment variable for safe testing and validation
  - Uses real API data for validation while simulating mutations
  - All 28 MCP tools support dry-run mode with comprehensive logging
  - Perfect for testing automations, learning the API, and safe experimentation
- **Task Search**: Update/delete/complete operations support both:
  - **Task ID**: Direct lookup by ID (more reliable, takes precedence)
  - **Task Name**: Case-insensitive partial string matching against task content
- **Task Identification**: When both `task_id` and `task_name` are provided, ID takes precedence
- **Due Dates vs Deadlines**:
  - `due_string`/`due_date`: When the task appears in "Today" (start date)
  - `deadline_date`: Actual deadline for task completion (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Bulk Operations**: Use bulk tools (e.g., `todoist_tasks_bulk_create`) when working with multiple tasks to improve efficiency and reduce API calls
- **Bulk Search Criteria**: Bulk operations support flexible filtering by project, priority, due dates, and content matching
  - **Empty String Handling (Security Fix v0.8.8)**: Empty or whitespace-only strings in `content_contains` now correctly match NO tasks (not all tasks)
  - **Minimum Criteria Requirement**: At least one valid search criterion must be provided for bulk operations
- **Project Name Resolution**: The `todoist_tasks_bulk_update` tool supports both project IDs and project names in the `project_id` field. Project names are automatically resolved to IDs
- **Testing**: Use `todoist_test_all_features` after making changes to ensure functionality works correctly
- **Linting**: Always run `npm run lint -- --fix` after making changes to auto-fix formatting issues
- **Type Safety**: When TypeScript compilation fails due to API changes, use defensive type assertions with proper interfaces rather than disabling strict checking
- **Development Workflow**: For API response handling, prefer using `extractArrayFromResponse()` helper function over inline type assertions

**Planned Future Phases:**
- **Phase 4**: Completed Tasks Retrieval (v0.9.0) - Todoist Sync API v9 integration for accessing completed tasks
  - **Motivation**: REST API v2 cannot retrieve completed/archived tasks - only active tasks
  - **Solution**: Hybrid architecture - add Sync API v9 client alongside existing REST API client
  - **Sync API Client**: Create `src/utils/sync-api-client.ts` for raw HTTP calls to Sync API endpoints
    - Primary endpoint: `GET /sync/v9/completed/get_all` - retrieves all completed items
    - Secondary endpoint: `GET /sync/v9/completed/get_by_ids` - retrieves completed items by parent IDs
    - Authentication: Same Bearer token as REST API
    - Response format: JSON with `items` array containing tasks with `checked: true` and `completed_at` timestamp
  - **Completed Task Handler**: Create `src/handlers/completed-task-handlers.ts` for business logic
    - Retrieve completed tasks with comprehensive filtering (project, labels, date ranges, content search)
    - Client-side filtering after fetch (Sync API has limited server-side filter support)
    - Integration with existing CacheManager (60-second TTL for completed tasks)
  - **New MCP Tool**: Single tool `todoist_completed_tasks_get` with comprehensive filtering
    - Filter by project ID or name
    - Filter by label IDs or names
    - Filter by completion date range (`completed_after`, `completed_before`)
    - Filter by original due date range
    - Filter by content/description search
    - Limit results for performance
  - **Type Definitions**: Extend `src/types.ts` with Sync API response interfaces
    - `SyncCompletedTask` interface for completed task structure
    - `GetCompletedTasksArgs` interface for MCP tool arguments
  - **Type Guards**: Add `isGetCompletedTasksArgs()` validation in `src/type-guards.ts`
  - **Tool Definition**: Create `src/tools/completed-task-tools.ts` with MCP tool schema
  - **Server Integration**: Wire up in `src/index.ts` (tool registration, handler routing)
  - **Dry-Run Support**: Extend dry-run wrapper to support Sync API simulation
  - **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for Sync API client and completed tasks
  - **Total Impact**: ~400 lines, 7 files (3 new, 4 modified), 29 total MCP tools
  - **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing 28 tools continue working unchanged
  - **No New Dependencies**: Use Node.js native `fetch` for HTTP requests
- **Phase 5**: Duplicate Detection - Smart task deduplication using similarity algorithms
- **Phase 6**: Project Analytics - Comprehensive project health metrics and insights

All future development should use the testing infrastructure to validate changes and ensure compatibility.
